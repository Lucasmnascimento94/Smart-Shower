# Smart-Shower

This is an extended version of the project I made for my computer arquitecture class. 

# Goal
The Smart-Shower aims to provide a more efficient, personalized, and intelligent way to manage the shower experience. In many homes—mine included—it can take several minutes for water to reach a comfortable temperature due to the delay in hot water arriving through the pipes. Manually adjusting the valve each time is tedius and this system introduces a smart interface to control the shower valve (or other applicable valves) with a focus on user comfort, energy efficiency, and system safety.

# Features
-> Personalized Temperature Presets: Each user can save their preferred shower temperature settings for one-touch access.

-> Remote Start Functionality: Users can activate the shower remotely, allowing the water to reach the desired temperature before they step in—eliminating wait time.

-> Hot Water Monitoring: Tracks the decline of hot water temperature and alerts the user when they are about to run out—especially useful for homes that use hot water tanks.

-> Usage Tracking: Monitors water and energy usage per session. Data is logged and associated with individual users for long-term insights and potential conservation.

-> Cold Temperature Alert: Sends a warning if pipe temperatures drop too low, helping to prevent frozen or burst pipes—especially relevant for homes in colder northern climates (like mine).

The first version was made using an ATMEGA 168A, coded in assembly and all the assembled componnets were placed with loose wires in some protoboards.
